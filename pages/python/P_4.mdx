# Practical_3 😶‍🌫️

### 1.	Explain difference between insert, append and extend operations on list. Write a program to create and initialize list with your name, enrollment number, age, branch and result. Perform insert, remove, update, append and extend operation on list.

```py copy
l1=["Dhruv",20012011055,19,"CE",8.45]
print(l1)
l1.insert(2,"lakhnai")
print("After insert value at index 2:-",l1)
print(l1)
print( )
l1.remove("CE")
print("After remove CE from list:-",l1)
print(l1)
print( )
l1.append("Kherva")
print("After append Kherva in list",l1)
print(l1)
print( )
l1.extend(["GANPAT UNI",1110,"UVPCE"])
print("After add a sublist in list",l1)
print(l1)
```
### 2.	Write a program to search an element, find maximum & minimum value from the list. 
```py copy
l1=[918,265,323,402,588,666,723]
print(l1)
n=int(input("Enter the number to find:-"))
print("Given elements is present at index:",l1.index(n))
print("Maximum element present in list:",max(l1))
print("Minimum element present in list:",min(l1))

```
#### 2. Using for loop
```py copy
l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(l1)
n = int(input("Enter number for FIND :"))
count= -1
temp = 0
for x in l1:
    count += 1
    if x == n:
         temp = 1
         print(x)
         break
if temp==1:
    print("Given element is present at index:-",count)
else:
    print("Entered element is not in list")
maxno = l1[0]
minno = l1[0]
for x in l1:
    if x > maxno:
         maxno = x
for x in l1:
    if x < minno:
         minno = x
print("MAX element in list is {}".format(maxno))
print("MIN element in list is {}".format(minno))

```

### 3.	Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
```py copy
n = int(input("Enter number :-"))
l1 = []
temp = 1
while temp <= n:
    if n % temp == 0:
        l1.append(temp)
    temp += 1
print("Divisors of numbers are:-")
print(l1)

```

### 4.WAP to sort element in list 
```py copy
l1 = [41,22,15,83,10,74,66]
l1.sort()
print("After sort:-",l1)

```

### 5.	Take two lists, say for example these two: a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]  and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
```py copy
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
c = []
for i in a:
    if i in b and i not in c:
        c.append(i)
print(c)

```

### 6.	Write a Python program which takes a list and returns a list with the elements "Shifted left by one position" so [1, 2, 3] yields [2, 3, 1]. Example: [11, 12, 13] → [12, 13, 11]
```py copy
l1 = []
n = int(input("How many Elements you want to Enter:"))
for i in range(0, n):
    l1.append(int(input("Enter index {} element :".format(i))))
print("List Before Shifted")
print(l1)
temp = l1[0]
for i in range(0, len(l1)-1):
    l1[i] = l1[i+1]
    l1[len(l1)-1] = temp
print("List after Shifted")
print(l1)

```
### 7.	Write a program which takes a comma separated string from user & store each string which separated by comma in list & display list.
```py copy
i=1
list1=[]
while i!=0:
    str=input("Enter a String:-")
    list1.append(str)
    i=int(input("Press 0 for exit:-"))
print(list1)

```

### 8.	Write a program to create and initialize the tuple. Also remove 3rd element from tuple.
```py copy
t= (5,7,8,9,6,4)
print('tuple:-',t)
t = t[:2]+t[3:]
print("after removing 3rd element:-",t)

```
### 9.	Create a tuple with name courses and initialize it with JAVA, PHP, C#, Android. Insert two items HTML and Python at the 3rd position in tuple.
```py copy  
courses = ('JAVA', 'PHP', 'C#', 'Android')
print("Tuple courses:")
print(courses)
x = ('HTML', 'Python')
courses = courses[:2] + (x,) + courses[2:]
print("Tuple after add elements at 3rd position:")
print(courses)

```
