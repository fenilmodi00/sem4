### 1.	Create and print a dictionary that contains keys a,b,c,d with their values 1,2,3 and 4 respectively using curly bracket syntax and ‘dict’ in built function. 
```py copy
d={"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4}
print(d)
print(type(d))
```
### 2.	Using above created dictionary perform following operations
#### 1 Write a code to print out the value of a, d, and c. 
```py copy
d={"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4}
print(d["a"],d["c"],d["d"])
```
#### 2 Calculate the sum of the value of a,b,c,d and print it.
```py copy
d={"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4}
print(d["a"]+d["b"]+d["c"]+d["d"])

```

#### 3 Add a new key, value pair (e,5) to the dictionary and print dictionary.
```py copy  
d={"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4}
d["e"]=5
print(d)

```

### 3.	Filter the dictionary by removing all items with a value greater than  
```py copy
d={"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5}
l1=[]
for x,y in d.items():
    if(y>2):
        l1.append(x)
print(l1)

for i in l1:
    d.pop(i)
print("After delete value is greater than 2:-",d)

```
### 4.	Print the names which contain the character 'a' from the dictionary containing 2 lists of male and female students given below.
```py copy
d={"male": ["Tom", "Charlie", "Harry", "Frank"],
    "female":["Sarah", "Huda", "Samantha", "Emily", "Elizabeth"] }
for i in d.values():
    for a in i:
        if "a" in a:
            print(a)

```

### 5.	You have 4 films in the dictionary with the age and number of seats available as indicated below. Write a programme to ask for a film and check for the person that he is eligible to watch movie, also check ticket availability and movie availability in the cinema. 
```py copy
d={"War": [3,5],
        "Bourne": [18,5],
        "Gully boy": [15,5],
        "Uri":[12, 5]
}
print(d)
movie=input("Enter movie you like:-")

if movie  not in d.keys():
    print("Movie is not in Cinema")

else:
    age=int(input("Enter your Age:-"))
    
    if(age>=d[movie][0]):
        seat=int(input("Enter how many seat:-"))
        if(seat<=d[movie][1]):
            print("Seat is available")
        else:
            print("Housefull")
    else:
        print("You are eligible for movie")

```
