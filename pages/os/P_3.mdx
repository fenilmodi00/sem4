#### 1 Write a shell script to calculate the loss percentage of an article. Scan the cost price and selling price

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

echo Enter Cost Price :
read cp
echo Enter Sell Price :
read sp
v1=`expr $cp - $sp`
v2=`expr $v1 \* 100`
v3=`expr $v2 / $cp`
echo Your lost percentage is $v3%.
```

#### 2 Write a shell script to accept numbers below 50 and to display the square of each. This should continue as long as the user wishes.

```bash copy

while [ 1 ]
do
echo Enter Number less than 50 :
read no
while [ $no -gt 50 ]
do
echo Enter Number less than 50 :
read no
done
v1=`expr $no \* $no`
echo Square of $no is $v1.
echo Do you want to Exit \? E-Exit
read ch
if [ $ch = "e" -o $ch = "E" ]
then
exit
fi
done
```

#### 3 Write a shell script to display $50

```bash copy
 #!/bin/bash

echo "\$50"

```

#### 4 Write a shell script to check whether the scanned string is found in a file or not. Display appropriate message.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

echo Enter string you want to search :
read a
echo Enter file name :
read b
c=`grep $a $b`
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
echo $a is Present in file $b.
else
echo $a is not Present in file $b.
fi
```

#### 5 Write a shell script, which scans the name of the command and executes it.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

echo Enter any Command to Execute:
read command
$command

```

#### 6 Write a shell script which displays January if we enter Jan, Janu, Janua or January.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input month
echo Enter the name month:
read a
case $a in
jan|janu|janua|january)
echo January
;;
*)
echo Invalid Input
;;
esac


```

#### 7 Write a shell script to generate Fibonacci series

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the number of terms
read -p "Enter the number of terms: " n

# Initialize variables
a=0
b=1

# Print the first two terms
echo "The Fibonacci series is: "
echo "$a"
echo "$b"

# Loop to generate and print the remaining terms
for ((i=2; i<n; i++))
do
 c=$((a+b))
 echo "$c"
 a=$b
 b=$c
done
```
