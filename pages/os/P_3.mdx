#### 1 Write a shell script to calculate the loss percentage of an article. Scan the cost price and selling price

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter cost price: "
read cost_price

echo "Enter selling price: "
read selling_price

if (( selling_price < cost_price )); then
  loss=$(( cost_price - selling_price ))
  loss_percentage=$(( loss * 100 / cost_price ))
  echo "Loss percentage: $loss_percentage%"
else
  echo "No loss incurred"
fi
```

#### 2 Write a shell script to accept numbers below 50 and to display the square of each. This should continue as long as the user wishes.

```bash copy
 #!/bin/bash

while true; do
  read -p "Enter a number below 50: " num
  if [[ $num -lt 50 ]]; then
    square=$((num*num))
    echo "The square of $num is $square"
  else
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number below 50."
  fi
  read -p "Do you want to continue? (y/n) " cont
  if [[ $cont == "n" ]]; then
    break
  fi
done
```

#### 3 Write a shell script to display $50

```bash copy
 #!/bin/bash

echo "\$50"

```

#### 4 Write a shell script to check whether the scanned string is found in a file or not. Display appropriate message.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input string
read -p "Enter a string to search: " search_string

# Get the input file name
read -p "Enter a file name to search in: " file

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
   echo "File not found."
   exit 1
fi

# Search the file for the input string
if grep -q $search_string $file; then
   echo "The string '$search_string' was found in the file '$file'."
else
   echo "The string '$search_string' was not found in the file '$file'."
fi
```

#### 5 Write a shell script, which scans the name of the command and executes it.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input command
read -p "Enter a command to execute: " cmd

# Execute the command
$cmd

```

#### 6 Write a shell script which displays January if we enter Jan, Janu, Janua or January.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input month
read -p "Enter a month: " month

# Check the input month
case $month in
 Jan|Janu|Janua|January)
   echo "January"
   ;;
 *)
   echo "Invalid input"
   ;;
esac

```

#### 7 Write a shell script to generate Fibonacci series

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the number of terms
read -p "Enter the number of terms: " n

# Initialize variables
a=0
b=1

# Print the first two terms
echo "The Fibonacci series is: "
echo "$a"
echo "$b"

# Loop to generate and print the remaining terms
for ((i=2; i<n; i++))
do
 c=$((a+b))
 echo "$c"
 a=$b
 b=$c
done
```
