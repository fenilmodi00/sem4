# Practical_5 😶‍🌫️

#### 1 Write a Shell script to accept a string as command line argument and reverse the same.

```bash copy
str="$1" reversed_string="" len=${#str}
for (( i=$len-1; i>=0; i-- )) do
reversed_string="$reversed_string${str:$i:1}" done
echo "$reversed_string"
cho "The reversed string of '$string' is '$reversed_string'"

```

#### 2 Write a shell script to calculate the loss percentage of an article, given the cost price and the selling price as command line arguments.

```bash copy
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
echo "Usage: ./loss_percentage.sh <cost_price> <selling_price>" exit 1
fi

cost_price=$1 selling_price=$2

if (( $selling_price > $cost_price )); then profit=$(( $selling_price - $cost_price )) echo "Profit: $profit"
exit 0 else
loss=$(( $cost_price - $selling_price )) echo "Loss: $loss"
fi

loss_percentage=$(( $loss * 100 / $cost_price )) echo "Loss percentage: $loss_percentage%"

```

#### 3 Write a shell script to accept the name of the user and check out if the same has logged in or not

```bash copy
echo "Please enter your username:" read username

if id "$username" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
echo "User '$username' exists on the system." else
echo "User '$username' does not exist on the system."
fi

```

#### 4 Write a shell script to check whether the file whose name is scanned exists and readable.

```bash copy
echo "Please enter the filename:" read filename

if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
echo "File '$filename' exists on the system."

if [ -r "$filename" ]; then
echo "File '$filename' is readable."
 else
echo "File '$filename' is not readable."
fi else
echo "File '$filename' does not exist on the system."
Fi

```

#### 5 Write a shell script to check if the input string is a palindrome.

```bash copy
echo "Please enter a string:" read input_string
reverse_string=$(echo "$input_string" | rev) if [ "$input_string" = "$reverse_string" ]; then
echo "The string '$input_string' is a palindrome."
else
echo "The string '$input_string' is not a palindrome."
fi


```

#### 6 . Write a shell script to accept a number and a word as command line arguments and print the word the given number of times on each line.

```bash copy
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
echo "Usage: ./print_word.sh <number> <word>" exit 1
fi

number=$1 word=$2

for (( i=1; i<=$number; i++ )); do echo "$word"
done


```

#### 7 Write a shell script to find the file or directory with the maximum size in the current directory

```bash copy
max_size=$(du -hs * | sort -rh | head -n 1)

echo "The file or directory with the maximum size in the current directory is:" echo "$max_size"

```

#### 8 Write a shell script to accept two filenames and check if both exist. If the second filename exists, then the contents of the first filename should be appended to it. If the second filename does not exist then create a newfile with the contents of the first file

```bash copy
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
echo "Usage: ./append_file.sh <filename1> <filename2>" exit 1
fi

filename1=$1 filename2=$2

if [ ! -f "$filename1" ]; then
echo "File '$filename1' does not exist." exit 1
fi

if [ -f "$filename2" ]; then
cat "$filename1" >> "$filename2"
echo "The contents of '$filename1' were appended to '$filename2'." else
cp "$filename1" "$filename2"
echo "A new file '$filename2' was created with the contents of '$filename1'." fi


```

#### 9 Write a shell script to accept a number in the command line and displays the sum up to that number. By default, the sum up to 50 should be displayed.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then n=50
else
n=$1 fi sum=0
for (( i=1; i<=$n; i++ )); do sum=$((sum+i))
done
echo "The sum up to $n is: $sum"
cho "The sum up to $number is $sum"

```

#### 10 Write a shell script to find the number of ordinary files and directory files in the current directory

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

num_files=0 num_directories=0

for file in *; do
# Check if the file is a regular file if [ -f "$file" ]; then num_files=$((num_files+1))

elif [ -d "$file" ]; then num_directories=$((num_directories+1)) fi
done

echo "Number of ordinary files: $num_files" echo "Number of directories: $num_directories"

```

#### 11 Write a shell script to accept an alphabet from the user and list all the files/directory starting with that alphabet in the current directory

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter an alphabet: "
read alphabet

echo "Files/directories starting with $alphabet:"

read -p "Enter an alphabet: " letter ls -d $letter*

```
