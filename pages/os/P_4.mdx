echo -e "Enter Number : \c"
read n
for((i=2; i<=$n/2; i++))
do
ans=$(( n%i ))
if [ $ans -eq 0 ]
then
echo "$n is not a prime number."
exit 0
fi
done
echo "$n is a prime number."

```

#### 2 Write a shell script to calculate HRA of employees depending upon their basic

```bash copy
echo Enter the salary :
read sal
echo Enter the HRA Percentage :
read hra
if [ $hra -lt 100 ]
then
temp=` expr $sal \* $hra `
hra=` expr $temp / 100 `
echo Total HRA is $hra.
else
Enter valid HRA Percentage.
fi

# Print the HRA
echo "The HRA is: $hra"

```

#### 3 Write a shell script that greets the user by saying Good Morning, Good Afternoon, and Good Evening according to the system time.

```bash copy
time=` date +%H `
if [ $time -lt 12 ]

```bash copy
echo "Please enter the filename: "
read filename


if [ ! -f "$filename" ]; then
  echo "The file $filename does not exist."
  exit 1
fi


echo "Do you want to revoke the read and write permissions for the group and others for the file $filename? (y/n)"
read answer

if [ "$answer" = "y" ]; then
  chmod go-rw "$filename"
  echo "The read and write permissions for the group and others for the file $filename have been revoked."
else
  echo "Operation aborted."
fi

```

#### 5 Write a shell script that asks the capital of Gujarat and repeats the question until the user gives correct answer.

read no
a=` head -$no $file | tail -1 `
echo $a
```

#### 7 Write a shell script to count number of newline characters in a file.

```bash copy
echo Enter file name
read fn
x=`wc $fn|cut -d " " -f 2`

 echo "The number of newline characters in the file is '$x' "
```

#### 8 Write a shell script to count number of spaces in a file.

```bash copy
echo "input file name"
read file
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
 echo "File not found."
 exit 1
fi
space_count=$(grep -o ' ' $file | wc -l)
echo "The number of spaces in the file '$file' is $space_count"

```

#### 9 Write a Shell script, which counts the number of words in a file, without taking into consideration the blank space, tab spaces and the newline characters using WC

```bash copy
echo Enter the filename
read fn

if [ ! -f $x ]; then
 echo "File not found."
 exit 1
fi

x=`wc -w $fn | cut -d " " -f1`
echo No. of words in file : $x


echo "The number of words in the file is  '$x' "


```

#### 10 0. Write a Shell script, which counts the number of words in a file, without taking into consideration the blank space, tab spaces and the newline characters without using WC

```bash copy

echo Enter the filename
read file

if [[ ! -f "$file" ]]; then
  echo "Error: File $file does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

c=0
for i in `cat $file`
do
        c=`expr $c + 1`
done
echo No. of words are: $c




```

#### 11 Write a Shell script, which counts the number of characters in a file, without taking into consideration the blank space, tab spaces and the newline characters using WC.

```bash copy

echo Enter the file name
read file
c=0
sum=0
for i in `cat $file`
do
        x=`echo $i|wc -c`
        sum=`expr $sum + $x`
        c=`expr $c + 1`
done
sum=`expr $sum - $c`
echo No of char are: $sum

```

#### 12 Write a Shell script, which counts the number of characters in a file, without taking into consideration the blank space, tab spaces and the newline characters without using WC.

```bash copy

echo "Enter the file name:"
read filename

if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
    count=0
    while read -r line; do
        for (( i=0; i<${#line}; i++ )); do
            char="${line:i:1}"
            if [[ "$char" != " " && "$char" != "\t" && "$char" != "\n" ]]; then
                count=$((count+1))
            fi
        done
    done < "$filename"
    echo "The number of non-blank characters in $filename is: $count"
else
    echo "File not found."
fi

```
