#### 1 Write a shell script to check whether the entered number is prime or not

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input number
read -p "Enter a number: " num

# Check if the number is less than 2
if [ $num -lt 2 ]; then
  echo "Invalid input. Number must be greater than 1."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the number is prime
for ((i=2; i<=num/2; i++))
do
  if [ $((num%i)) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$num is not a prime number."
    exit 0
  fi
done

echo "$num is a prime number."

```

#### 2 Write a shell script to calculate HRA of employees depending upon their basic

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the basic salary
read -p "Enter the basic salary: " basic

# Calculate the HRA
if [ $basic -lt 5000 ]
then
  hra=`echo "$basic*0.1" | bc`
elif [ $basic -lt 10000 ]
then
  hra=`echo "$basic*0.2" | bc`
else
  hra=`echo "$basic*0.3" | bc`
fi

# Print the HRA
echo "The HRA is: $hra"

```

#### 3 Write a shell script that greets the user by saying Good Morning, Good Afternoon, and Good Evening according to the system time.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

current_time=$(date +%H)
if [ $current_time -lt 12 ]; then
  echo "Good morning!"
elif [ $current_time -lt 18 ]; then
  echo "Good afternoon!"
else
  echo "Good evening!"
fi

```

#### 4 Write a shell script, which takes a filename as command line argument, asks the user if he wants to revoke the read, write permissions for the group and others for that particular file. If the answer is “y” then it should do so or else it should abort the operation.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input file name
file=$1

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
    echo "File not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Ask user if they want to revoke permissions
read -p "Do you want to revoke read, write permissions for the group and others for the file '$file'? (y/n) " choice

# Check user choice
if [ $choice == "y" ]; then
    # Revoke permissions
    chmod o-rw $file
    chmod g-rw $file
    echo "Permissions revoked for the file '$file'."
else
    echo "Aborting operation."
fi

```

#### 5 Write a shell script that asks the capital of Gujarat and repeats the question until the user gives correct answer.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  read -p "What is the capital of Gujarat? " answer
  if [ $answer == "Gandhinagar" ]; then
    echo "Correct!"
    break
  else
    echo "Incorrect, please try again."
  fi
done
```

#### 6 Write a shell script to display desired line from a file

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input file name
file=$1

# Get the input line number
line_number=$2

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
    echo "File not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Display the desired line
sed -n "${line_number}p" $file
```

#### 7 Write a shell script to count number of newline characters in a file.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input file name
file=$1

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
    echo "File not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Count the number of newline characters in the file
newline_count=$(grep -o $'\n' $file | wc -l)

# Print the result
echo "The number of newline characters in the file '$file' is $newline_count"

```

#### 8 Write a shell script to count number of spaces in a file.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input file name
file=$1

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
    echo "File not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Count the number of spaces in the file
space_count=$(grep -o ' ' $file | wc -l)

# Print the result
echo "The number of spaces in the file '$file' is $space_count"

```

#### 9 Write a Shell script, which counts the number of words in a file, without taking into consideration the blank space, tab spaces and the newline characters using WC

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input file name
file=$1

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
    echo "File not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Count the number of words in the file
word_count=$(cat $file | tr -d ' \t\n' | wc -w)

# Print the result
echo "The number of words in the file '$file' is $word_count"

```

#### 10 0. Write a Shell script, which counts the number of words in a file, without taking into consideration the blank space, tab spaces and the newline characters without using WC

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input file name
file=$1

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
    echo "File not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Count the number of words in the file
word_count=0
while IFS= read -r line
do
  word_count=$(($word_count + $(echo $line | tr -sc 'A-Za-z0-9' ' ' | wc -w)))
done < $file

# Print the result
echo "The number of words in the file '$file' is $word_count"

```

#### 11 Write a Shell script, which counts the number of characters in a file, without taking into consideration the blank space, tab spaces and the newline characters using WC.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input file name
file=$1

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
    echo "File not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Count the number of characters in the file
char_count=$(cat $file | tr -d ' \t\n' | wc -m)

# Print the result
echo "The number of characters in the file '$file' is $char_count"

```

#### 12 Write a Shell script, which counts the number of characters in a file, without taking into consideration the blank space, tab spaces and the newline characters without using WC.

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash

# Get the input file name
file=$1

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f $file ]; then
    echo "File not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Count the number of characters in the file
char_count=0
while IFS= read -r line
do
  char_count=$(($char_count + $(echo $line | tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9' | wc -c)))
done < $file

# Print the result
echo "The number of characters in the file '$file' is $char_count"

```
